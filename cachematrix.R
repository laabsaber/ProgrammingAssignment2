## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
## We assume that the matrix supplied is always invertible.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        i <- NULL
        set <- function(y) {
                x <<- y
                i <<- NULL
        }
        get <- function() x
        setInverse <- function(inverse) i <<- inverse
        getInverse <- function() i
        list(set = set, get = get,
             setInverse = setInverse,
             getInverse = getInverse)
}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix"
## returned by makeCacheMatrix.
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed),
## then cacheSolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
		##where 'x' is a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
        i <- x$getInverse()
        if(!is.null(i)) {
                message("getting cached data")
                return(i)
        }
        data <- x$get()
        i <- solve(data, ...)
        x$setInverse(i)
        i		
}
